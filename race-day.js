/*
This a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age).
They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:
Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:
Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

// Race numbers are assigned randomly
// Ensure we only have whole numbers from 0 to 999
let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);


// Create a variable that indicates whether a runner registered early or not
const registeredEarly = true;
// Uncomment below to test and comment above to test
//const registeredEarly = false;


// Create a variable for the runner's age
// Change to test
const age = 25;

// Create a control flow statement that checks whether the runner is an adult AND registered early
if (age > 18 && registeredEarly) {
  raceNumber += 1000;

}

// Creat a separate control floe statement that checks age and registration time
if (age > 18 && registeredEarly) {
  console.log(`Runner ${raceNumber}: Your race starts at 9:30.`);
} else if (age > 18 && !registeredEarly) {
  console.log(`Runner ${raceNumber}: Your race starts at 11:00.`);
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log(`Runner ${raceNumber}: Your race starts at 12:30.`)
} else {
  console.log(`Runner ${raceNumber}: Please see the registration desk.`);
